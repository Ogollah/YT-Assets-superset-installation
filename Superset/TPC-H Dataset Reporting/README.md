## Reporting with Apache Superset

![World Population](./assets/report-screenshot-tpc-h.jpeg)


We will be building above report in apache superset.


To build this report we are using PostgreSQL database. All the data used is generated using TPC dataset generator([TPC Website](https://www.tpc.org/tpc_documents_current_versions/current_specifications5.asp))


#### DATA MODEL

To develope report we need data model as superset does not support modeling like many reporting tools supports. Hence we will be creating a flat view on top of this model.

I will be placing exports of reports and provide links here.
